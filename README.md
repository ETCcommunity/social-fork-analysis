# Social Fork Analysis
A social network analysis toolkit is actively being designed to create an easy to use data set for journalists and researchers interested in exploring the affects of social media on the decision making process of the Ethereum community.

**Scrape Tools: extracting and saving data**

The scape tools included with this repository is designed to easily:

  (1) GET data from relevant social media servers,
  
  (2) extract data from the DOM, and
  
  (3) compile relevant data into simple data structures.
  

The scraping tools search defined social media networks, filtering relevant content created by the Ethereum community between:

    Time.new((DAO Catastrophe) - 7) until Time.now
  
Relevant content is extracted from the DOM and stored in a simple structure. 


## Save the state of public data
The primary purpose is to ensure a reliable saved state of all the relevant social media data exists and is freely available before social media content can be further modified or deleted. 

This software was initialized to create tools to faciliate research for an article I'm writing. Using hindsight clarity, the article looks back over the events, attempts to identify patterns and chronicle the events accurately as possible from the perspective of a unaffiliated but active developer.


### Development progress

*Are you interested in volunteering to build tools for journalists and researchers?*
*Use the table below to determine: what needs to be done, where you are capable of contributing and add your name to the cell. Two and more volunteers can work on the same script, add your name using a comma separation.*

*If the scripts are built in a modular way, they can be improved and expanded to work for other events were social media data may be important.*
